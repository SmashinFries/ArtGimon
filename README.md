# Art Gimon `🚧ALPHA🚧` 
`🤖Android` `🌐Web(planned)`

A game about questioning AI art and drawn art.

## About
`🖼️SCREENSHOTS SOON🖼️`

I sometimes find myself going through my Instagram and when an artwork comes up, I try to guess if it was drawn by a human or made with AI. Many times it's easy to tell, but there are times when I really can't.

So why not make a game of it?

## Development Status
This game is currently in alpha phase. It is playable but it only has one game mode and is far from polished. 

I am still figuring out a good UI design, so don't be too upset with me 😵.

I will be activily working on this game, but do keep in mind that I also have other ongoing projects.
